# How to install:

### **Python**:
You will need to install the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ "requests") library, by typing in your console:

`pip install requests`



### **Windows**:
**Download the latest build [here](https://github.com/AlessioScarlet/TotalGasFeesCalculator/raw/main/TotalGasFeesCalculator.exe)**

I compiled it with [autopytoexe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/).
It will take some time to load (about 5 seconds).

**Warning!**

When you download the .exe, your browser might detect it as a virus. It usually happens with programs that have got too few downloads.
The [VirusTotal Scan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ff991121e628e11fcfdff849e658954dc2310d2fd37581bf42536eed287b1fd3/detection) shows that it's not harmful, at best it gets detected as a "Heuristic threat". 
This is a common thing happening when using [autopytoexe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) to convert python files to exe.
In any case, remember that you can always use the Python file, as it is opensource and you can just look at it.
